This REST application allows users to rate and comment on books in the database.

Each rating given by a user to a book may include a numerical rating and commentary. Additionally, each rating has a date of issue. The rating is assigned to both the book and the user account, who later has access to the ratings they have issued and can view them.

A user with administrator privileges can add new books to the database and, if necessary, delete comments from users and their accounts.
